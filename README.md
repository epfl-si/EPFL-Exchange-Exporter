AUTH_SECRET=
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=

AUTH_EWS_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME=
AUTH_EWS_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=
AUTH_EWS_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=
```

with :


**AUTH_SECRET** : generated with **`npx auth`**. Read more: https://cli.authjs.dev>

**AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID** : the **id** of **Microsoft entra id** app

**AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET** : the **secret** of **Microsoft entra id** app

**AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_TENANT_ID** : the **tenant** id of **Microsoft entra id** app

### üì• INSTALLATION

After configuring, now you can start this application by the command below :

```bash
npm install
```

>[!NOTE]
>If there vulnerabilities, try to solve them by using
> ```bash
> npm audit fix
> ```
> If it is not enough, try this command
> ```bash
> npm audit fix --force
> ```
>
> If it still not enough, try to replace dependancies by another

## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è RUN IN DEVELOPMENT

After that, when all dependencies are installed, you can do  this command to run this app :

```bash
npm run dev
```

### üà≥ Mutli-lang

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Modify existing text

To modify exiting text, you need to go to the [translations/](translations/) folder, select the file in the language you wanna change the text, and edit it.
>[!TIP]
>Filename is defined with the country code 2 letters of the language

#### ‚ûï Add a new language

There is multiple steps to add a new language (here, we will take german) :

- First, you need to go to the [translations/](translations/) folder
- Duplicate one of existing file, and change the filename to the language name (2 letters format, so here it's "de")
- The file is a JSON, with key-value pair, please change only value to avoid break changes, to translate all text.
- Next, go to the [routing.js](src/i18n/routing.js) file, and inside the list added to `locales` (line 5 normally), add your 2 letters language format, so here "de", from
  ```js
  locales: ['en', 'fr']
  ```
  to
  ```js
  locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de']
  ```
>[!NOTE]
>The last step is important to have the /de, like https://example.com/de

## üöÄ DEPLOY IN TEST / PROD

For this project, some feature has been created or is used to improve the deployment:
- [A Makefile](#‚úâÔ∏è-makefile) (to change version of package.json and package-lock.json, and commit / push in gitHub)
- A Workflow (to create a release, create a docker image with version and push the docker image to quay)
- [A Script](#üìÆ-sopsible) (deploy th app with iamge of the version selected, in test or prod)

### ‚úâÔ∏è MAKEFILE
With this makefile, you can change the version depend to type of change, and you can if you want git add, commit or push automaticaly. There is multiple type of command where all here :

- `help` => **get help guide**
- `version` => **define version manually (respecting X.X.X synthax)**
- `v` => **define version manually (respecting X.X.X synthax)**
- `patch` => **patch**
- `pt` => **patch**
- `pta` => **patch add**
- `ptc` => **patch commit**
- `ptp` => **patch push**
- `minor` => **minor**
- `mn` => **minor**
- `mna` => **minor add**
- `mnc` => **minor commit**
- `mnp` => **minor push**
- `major` => **major**
- `mj` => **major**
- `mja` => **major add**
- `mjc` => **major commit**
- `mjp` => **major push**

If you push or commit with one of theses command (ptc, ptp, mnc...), the commit message are the following :
```
[version] bump to v$(version)

modified version in package


From:   v$(old_version_package)
To:        v$(version)
```

>[!TIP]
> If you want, you can define a version manually with the command below :
> ```bash
> make version X.X.X
> ```

>[!WARNING]
> If you write manually the version, please take care about version. Write version like `X.X.X`, so for example `1.11.11`, but no `01.12` or no `1.11.11-test`. It is important because the makefile need to get 3 values (numeric only, integer values) separated with dots, to manage version with previous parameters.

### üìÆ SOPSIBLE
Sopsible is a script from [SOPEC REPO](https://github.com/epfl-si/sopec), to deploy app image in test or prod.
